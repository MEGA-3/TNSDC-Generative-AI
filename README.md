# TNSDC-Generative-AI
To generate musical notes using a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
Train a model using a collection of piano MIDI files from theÂ maestro dataset.
The objective of music generation is to explore deep learning regarding the field of music composition using artificial intelligence.
The project not only generate the music based on commands, but also shows what kind of musical instruments are used.
